		Configuration is centralized, itâ€™s not scattered among all different components so you can have a nice overview of beans and their wirings in a single place
		If you need to split your files, no problem, Spring let you do that. It then reassembles them at runtime through internal tags or external context files aggregation
		Only XML configuration allows for explicit wiring â€“ as opposed to autowiring. Sometimes, the latter is a bit too magical for my own taste. Its apparent simplicity hides real complexity: not only do we need to switch between by-type and by-name autowiring, but more importantly, the strategy for choosing the relevant bean among all eligible ones escapes but the more seasoned Spring developers. Profiles seem to make this easier, but is relatively new and is known to few
		Last but not least, XML is completely orthogonal to the Java file: thereâ€™s no coupling between the 2 so that the class can be used in more than one context with different configurations
		The sole problem with XML is that you have to wait until runtime to discover typos in a bean or some other stupid boo-boo. On the other side, using Spring IDE plugin (or the integrated Spring Tools Suite) definitely can help you there.
